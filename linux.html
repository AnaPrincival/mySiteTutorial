            <p>
                Linux began in 1991 as an independent project by Linus Torvalds, built around the idea of a free and open-source Unix-like kernel. Over time, it evolved into a complete ecosystem maintained collaboratively by thousands of developers. What started as a hobby OS became the backbone of scientific computing, servers, embedded systems and high-performance clusters. The strength of Linux comes from its modularity, its predictable behavior and the transparency of its architecture, which makes it ideal for engineering environments where control over the system matters.

                In Linux, interaction with the system often happens through a <em>shell</em>, which is the command interpreter that processes user instructions. Multiple shells exist, each with its own syntax and configuration model. The most widely used today is <strong>Bash</strong> (Bourne-Again Shell), standard in most modern distributions and known for its scripting capabilities and POSIX-style syntax. Research infrastructures and older EDA workflows, however, still rely on <strong>tcsh/csh</strong>, shells with a different grammar and separate initialization files. Understanding which shell is active is essential, because environment variables, startup files and even simple expressions differ significantly between them.
